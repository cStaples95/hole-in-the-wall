**Project Summary**

The purpose of our mobile application is to create a social media space where friends can share with each other the different kinds of food they've eaten and recommend their favorite restaurants. It can also be used to find somewhere new if you frequent a small selection of restaurants by using recommendations from your friends.

**Project Goals**

The main goals of this project are to:

1. Develop an app to give users a variety of restaurant recommendations based on places their friends recommend.
2. Bring business and attention to restaurants in the user's local area.
3. Give people a source to show off their favorite restaurants in the area.

**Product Features**

The features that this product will include are:

1. **App:** The application can be used on IOS or Android devices.
2. **Login:** Users can login to the application using their email address through firebase authentication.
3. **Profiles:** Users can maintain a profile with their name, profile picture, bio, friends list, and posts.
4. **Private Groups:** Allow users to form private groups that can give exclusive recommendations based on that group
5. **Hangouts:** Allow groups to set up meeting times for group outings, including a tally of who can make it or not.
6. **Voting:** Allow groups to vote on their next outings. .
7. **Newsfeed:** On a timeline of posts, the user can see the posts of other friends that they follow or private groups.
8. **Tags:** Users can add tags to the restaurant or food of choice, allowing for detailed search functionality. Links can also be added to a specific tag, taking the user to the restaurant's website or google page.

**Limitations**

Limitations of the product include, but are not limited to:

1. Can't guarantee the recommended restaurants will be good.
2. Can't guarantee your friend group will have recommendations to places you haven't visited.

**Stretch Goals**

Some additional features that we would like to include are:

1. Using data from review websites like Yelp, include a general rating of the restaurant.
